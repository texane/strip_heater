This project aims at building a cheap strip heater with
parts that are easy to source.

A strip heater heats a thermo formable material (plexiglass
...) along a line so that the material can be bent along this
line. This is useful to rapidly make parts for personnal
projects, such as enclosures, robotics or decorative elements.

After some research, I found a project whose design perfectly
matches what I had in mind:
http://www.circuitbenders.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76:essai-thermo-plieuse&catid=40:regis&Itemid=59
I reused this design as the basis, but plan to extend or add
some elements. Especially, add a bend angle limiting mechanism
and a different current controller.

The bill of materials can be found here:
